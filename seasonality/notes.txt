Fit function: Baseline + Variable*(1+cos(2*pi*(x-Shift)/12))

For Covid:	

Baseline = 2171.03341673223
Variable = 911.365845243164
Shift = 1.21945458910288

For Flu (2018-2019 season):

BaselineF = 0 [pinned]
VariableF = 214.481629189435
ShiftF = 1.54539395290907
    
The shift indicates a peak in mid-January, as the months
are numbered from 1 in the data.

Flu is enormously variable, truly seasonal, going from a 
literal handful of cases in late summer to hundreds
in January.

Covid is at most very mildly seasonal: the baseline is
as large af the variability, so there is always a lot of
covid around. When anyone has a "summer cold"
these days, it is almost certainly covid.


Some other viruses follow similar pattern to flu:

Also: "Annual seasonality of RSV was observed in all countries, which overlapped to a large extent with the influenza activity."

But: it appears rhinovirus is more like covid:
